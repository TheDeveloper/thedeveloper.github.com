Inaugural post I wrote for the GoSquared engineering blog: [10 Vital Aspects of Building a Node.JS Application](https://engineering.gosquared.com/10-vital-aspects-of-building-a-node-js-application)

As this was the first proper post on the GoSquared Engineering blog, I spent a fair amount of time over the preceding few weeks putting together a substantial post superficially covering some of the most important points of consideration when building a Node.JS app.

This post was particularly successful, spending most of the launch day on the frontpage of [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4982124) and featuring in the [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/archive/111.html). This pumped some decent traffic to the blog:
