Learning a programming language, whether you’re new to programming or not, is a fantastic way to expand your skills, solve puzzles in exciting new ways, and deepen your overall experience. However, in order to succeed to the point where you’re self-sufficiently blazing out quality code, you need to keep your eye on the ball.

This post is based on my experiences of learning how to code, what worked for me, and what I observed along the way. By all means your experience may be different, as everyone learns in their own unique way. Notwithstanding this, I hope this helps shape a clearer picture of how you can most effectively attack it in your own way.

### Before you begin

Programming is a challenge, especially if you’ve never done it before. One of the most important forces to get you through any kind of challenge is motivation. If you want to get good, you need a damn good reason to keep you going, otherwise you’ll probably lose interest and bottle it.

The best motivation you can have is a downright insatiable compulsion to be better, know more, contribute more and achieve more by learning more languages. On top of this, you need to have genuine interest. This trumps any _necessity_ to learn a language, and you’ll be far less effective if you’re forced to do it. To learn a language because you have to for a job, or school, or whatever is not insufficient to get you going, but it won’t make you good. What makes you good is the constant craving, almost addiction, to be brilliant at what you do. In that sense, I wouldn’t say it’s any different from any other kind of skill.

While motivation is key to driving you towards progress, you must not let it make you lose focus on a **realistically gradational** track of learning. Although you’ll want to learn as many concepts as you can as quickly as possible, this will only result in confusion and ultimately an ineffective way of grokking the language. The most solid way to progress is to **remain disciplined** and work through the material linearly. Baby steps. You know, _“you can’t run before you can walk”_, and all that clichéd crap. In essence you must be patient and fortify your knowledge gradually.

### Research phase

Before you go writing any code, it’s probably best to start off researching and reading about the language. Get a tutorial book, and even if you already know another language, read it through, including the basic parts. The worst that can happen is you spend a bit of time reinforcing core concepts, observing nuances between this language and the one you know, and getting a solid grasp of the syntax. This is especially important if you’re learning a dramatically different style of language, such as moving from Ruby to C++.

### Practical phase

Once you’ve read carefully through the tutorial and its examples, the value of that material drops away rapidly if you continue studying. It’s time to move into the practical phase, where you learn by **doing**. Save for tackling scientific problems or designing complex algorithms which would require more research, this is by far the best way from now on for improving your skills.

A perfect way to kick off this phase is to go about programmatically solving a problem you have, and more importantly **understand**. You wouldn’t write an analytical essay on Shakespeare’s The Tempest without first reading it, and much the same you’ll find it difficult solving a problem you don’t have or don’t understand.

In building [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com/), there were always parts that needed building. I was doing the web-based development initially on a basic LAMP stack. File upload submission forms, payment gateway integrations, a user account system, public site pages, scheduled server tasks, and all sorts populated a never ending list of “problems” that needed solving. Along the way you enhance your knowledge by searching for issues you encounter, discover previously unexplored areas and solutions, and expand your expertise at an increasingly rapid rate. Taking the basic concepts I learned from tutorials further to the point of solving these problems in a way I sculpted was incredibly satisfying. Even though I’m talking primarily about web development here, this applies to any kind of programming platform.

The internet serves as your all-inclusive manual, reference guide, code collaboration and discussion network for you to absorb. There’s no shame in googling an unknown error code and perusing [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com) for the answer. It’s not lazy to make use of somebody else’s open source code in your own project. None of this is cheating. There’s no point in re-inventing the wheel if you can make use of and learn from somebody else’s work. That’s partly what [GitHub](https://github.com/) was made for.

### Advancement

All things considered, the way you’ll learn the most is by getting out there and **doing it**. When you don’t know, you **ask** or **research**. Chances are somebody’s solved the problem way before you, so embrace this is as a perfect way to fast-track your coding competency. You’ll notice when your skills are tending towards grand-mastery when results to your searches become decreasingly fruitful, and by this time you’ll likely be involved with open source projects, be writing about coding, and be the guy posting solutions and advising others. And potentially be looking to learn a new language all over again.
